  "ideal": "**H1 (Treg activation) is strongly supported; H2 (Fc-mediated CD8 depletion) is refuted.**\n\n**Evidence:**\n- CD8+ T cells are NOT depleted in HPD (1.4× increase, with modest Ki-67 activation at 22%), refuting H2's prediction of CD8 depletion.\n- Tregs are dramatically expanded in HPD (3.2× increase, Ki-67 from 12→48% = massive proliferation), with spatial invasion into tumor nests. This is precisely H1's prediction.\n- In responders, CD8+ cells expand 2.8× with robust activation (Ki-67 45%) while Tregs are stable — the effector:Treg balance shifts toward immunity.\n- The Treg:CD8 ratio is the key discriminator: HPD shifts from 0.3→0.7 (immunosuppressive); responders shift from 0.3→0.1 (immunocompetent).\n\n**Clinical implications:**\n1. **Pre-treatment Treg:CD8 ratio as a predictive biomarker:** Patients with high baseline Treg infiltration (>0.4 ratio) should be flagged as HPD risk. Consider combination with anti-CTLA-4 (which depletes Tregs via ADCC) before or concurrent with anti-PD-1.\n2. **Combination strategy for HPD-prone patients:** Anti-PD-1 + ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4, which depletes FoxP3+ Tregs through Fc-mediated ADCC) to counter Treg expansion. Alternative: anti-PD-1 + anti-CCR8 (selectively depletes intratumoral Tregs without systemic immune toxicity).\n3. **Early monitoring:** Liquid biopsy or on-treatment biopsy at week 3 measuring Treg expansion could enable early detection and treatment switch before clinical HPD manifests.\n4. **Patient exclusion from anti-PD-1 monotherapy:** Tumors with >50% FoxP3+ cells among CD4+ TILs should not receive anti-PD-1 alone.",
