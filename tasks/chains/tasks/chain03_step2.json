  "question": "Your DESeq2 analysis (paired model, n=15 per group) returns the following: 22,487 genes tested, 2,841 genes with raw p < 0.05, 1,573 genes with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p (FDR) < 0.05, 312 genes with FDR < 0.01. A collaborator suggests also running Bonferroni correction \"to be safe.\" (a) How many genes would survive Bonferroni at α=0.05? (b) Is this appropriate for this experiment? (c) The collaborator also notes that 2,841/22,487 = 12.6% of genes are significant at p<0.05, far above 5% — is this evidence that something is wrong? (d) What is the expected number of false positives at FDR < 0.05?",
  "ideal": "(a) Bonferroni threshold = 0.05/22,487 ≈ 2.2×10⁻⁶. Likely **50-150 genes** would survive (roughly the most extreme subset). (b) **Bonferroni is inappropriate** here — it controls the family-wise error rate (probability of *any* false positive), which is overly conservative for genomics where we expect many true positives. BH-FDR is standard because it controls the *proportion* of false discoveries, trading a small false positive rate for much greater power. (c) 12.6% at nominal p<0.05 is **expected and correct** — it reflects a true biological signal. Under the null (no DE genes), you'd expect exactly 5%. The excess (12.6% − 5% = 7.6% × 22,487 ≈ 1,700 genes) is the estimated true positive signal. This is the basis of the BH procedure. (d) At FDR < 0.05 with 1,573 significant genes, the expected number of false positives ≤ 0.05 × 1,573 ≈ **79 genes**. The remaining ~1,494 are expected true positives.",
