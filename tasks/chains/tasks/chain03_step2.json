  "question": "[FILL: Give results and ask for multiple testing correction.\nExample: 'Using the approach you recommended, you obtain p-values for 20,000 genes. 1,247 genes have p < 0.05. How should you correct for multiple testing? If you apply Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction at q < 0.05, approximately how many genes do you expect to remain significant, and how many would be false positives?']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Correct MTC reasoning.\nExample: 'Apply Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for FDR control. At FDR q < 0.05, approximately 5% of the significant genes are expected to be false positives. If ~800 genes survive BH correction, expect ~40 false positives. Bonferroni would be too conservative for 20,000 tests (threshold = 2.5e-6), likely missing many true positives.']",
