  "question": "[FILL: Ask for pathway analysis interpretation.\nExample: 'Your BH-corrected gene list (let us say ~800 genes) shows enrichment in the following GO terms: \"inflammatory response\" (p=1e-12, 45 genes), \"cell cycle\" (p=3e-8, 38 genes), \"apoptosis\" (p=0.02, 12 genes). A colleague argues all three are equally important since they are all significant. What is wrong with this reasoning, and how should you prioritize these pathways?']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Correct interpretation.\nExample: 'The colleague is confusing statistical significance with biological importance/effect size. 1) The p-values differ by 10 orders of magnitude — inflammatory response is far more robustly enriched. 2) Gene count matters: 45 vs 12 genes suggests different effect sizes. 3) The apoptosis enrichment (p=0.02) is marginal after correcting for the number of GO terms tested. Should prioritize inflammatory response for follow-up, treat apoptosis as exploratory.']",
