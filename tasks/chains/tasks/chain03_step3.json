Write them all up equally in the paper.\" What is wrong with this interpretation? Rank these results by biological relevance to TNBC and explain your reasoning.",
  "ideal": "The PI's interpretation has three problems: (1) **Not all results are equally significant.** P-values span 22 orders of magnitude. Ion transport (p=0.041) is barely significant and would likely not survive a more stringent threshold or an independent replication. (2) **Effect sizes differ dramatically.** Cell cycle (3.8× enrichment, 127 genes) is far more robust than ion transport (1.3× enrichment, 15 genes). Small fold-enrichments are biologically ambiguous. (3) **Biological coherence matters.** For TNBC specifically:\n\n**Tier 1 — Core to TNBC biology:**\n- Cell cycle: TNBC is defined by high proliferative index; this is the dominant signal and consistent with MKI67 overexpression.\n- DNA repair: TNBC is enriched for BRCA1/2 mutations (ClinVar lists >18,000 pathogenic BRCA2 variants) and homologous recombination deficiency — this is therapeutically actionable (PARP inhibitor sensitivity).\n\n**Tier 2 — Biologically relevant:**\n- Immune response: TNBC has the highest tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte levels among breast subtypes; immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab) now approved.\n- ECM organization: Consistent with TNBC's invasive phenotype.\n\n**Tier 3 — Weak/unclear:**\n- Apoptosis regulation: Marginal enrichment (1.6×), could be secondary to proliferation signal.\n- Ion transport: Barely significant, low enrichment, no known role in TNBC. Likely noise; would drop from manuscript.\n\nReport should weight by statistical significance × effect size × biological plausibility, not treat all as equal.",
