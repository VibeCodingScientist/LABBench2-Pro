  "question": "Results from your experiment:\n\n| Condition | Wound closure (% of WT) | Matrigel invasion (% of WT) | E-cadherin | Vimentin | ZEB2 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| WT | 100% | 100% | Low | High | Moderate |\n| ZEB1-KO | 210% | 38% (p<0.01) | High | Low | 1.3× (NS) |\n| Double-KO | 190% | 15% (p<0.001) | High | Very low | N/A |\n\nWhich hypothesis is supported? What does this mean for the interpretation of wound-healing assays in EMT research? What would you recommend to the field?",
  "ideal": "**H1 (collective migration) is strongly supported:**\n- ZEB1-KO cells are 2.1× faster in wound healing but only 38% as invasive through Matrigel — a clear dissociation between 2D migration and 3D invasion.\n- ZEB2 is NOT significantly upregulated (1.3×, NS), ruling out H2. The double-KO further reduces invasion (15%) without reducing wound closure speed (190%), confirming that the epithelial phenotype drives fast sheet migration but not matrix invasion.\n- Marker pattern is cleanly epithelial: E-cadherin restored, vimentin reduced. This is a collective epithelial migration phenotype.\n\n**Implications for EMT research:**\n1. **Wound-healing/scratch assays are misleading for EMT studies.** They measure 2D collective migration, which is *enhanced* by epithelial cell-cell adhesion, creating the paradox where EMT reversal appears to increase \"migration.\"\n2. **The field should use 3D invasion assays (Matrigel Transwell, spheroid invasion, collagen gel invasion) as the primary readout** for EMT-driven motility. Wound-healing assays should be clearly labeled as measuring \"collective migration\" not \"invasive potential.\"\n3. **EMT is not a single program.** Cells can be highly migratory (epithelial sheet migration) without being invasive (mesenchymal single-cell invasion). This distinction has clinical implications: metastatic potential correlates with invasion, not 2D migration speed.\n4. **Recommendation:** Papers studying EMT effects on motility should include both wound-healing AND Transwell invasion. Reports of \"increased migration\" upon MET (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition) likely reflect this collective migration artifact.",
