  "question": "Sotorasib achieves selectivity for KRAS G12C over wild-type KRAS and other G12 mutants (G12D, G12V). ChEMBL data shows sotorasib IC50 = 68 nM against KRAS G12C (CHEMBL4357259) but IC50 > 10,000 nM against wild-type KRAS (CHEMBL4735449) and KRAS G12D. Explain the molecular basis for this >150-fold selectivity window. Why can't sotorasib inhibit KRAS G12D even though both mutants activate the same RAS-MAPK pathway?",
  "ideal": "Sotorasib's selectivity has three components: (1) **Covalent selectivity:** The drug requires Cys12 as a nucleophile for irreversible bond formation. G12D has aspartate, G12V has valine — neither can react with the Michael acceptor. This is absolute selectivity; no amount of dose escalation can overcome it. (2) **Conformational selectivity:** Sotorasib binds only the GDP-bound state. G12C has the highest intrinsic GTPase rate among oncogenic KRAS mutants (~50% of WT hydrolysis rate), meaning a significant fraction of cellular KRAS G12C cycles through the GDP state. G12D and G12V have much lower GTPase activity (<1% of WT), staying locked in the GTP state where the S-IIP is closed. (3) **Pocket complementarity:** Even if a non-covalent version of sotorasib were designed, the S-IIP shape is subtly different across mutants due to how residue 12 influences P-loop positioning. The WT glycine at position 12 doesn't create the same pocket geometry. These combined mechanisms make KRAS G12C uniquely druggable among RAS proteins.",
