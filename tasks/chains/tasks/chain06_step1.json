  "question": "[FILL: Describe a protocol step and ask the model to identify what could go wrong.\nExample: 'You are performing a Western blot for phospho-ERK1/2 in HeLa cell lysates. You lyse cells in RIPA buffer, run SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, transfer to PVDF membrane, block with 5% non-fat milk in TBST, and incubate with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4C. You see no signal despite positive control working. What is the most likely error in this protocol?']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: The specific error.\nExample: 'Blocking with non-fat milk for a phospho-specific antibody. Milk contains casein, a phosphoprotein, which competes with phospho-epitopes and blocks the antibody from binding. Should use 5% BSA in TBST for phospho-antibodies.']",
