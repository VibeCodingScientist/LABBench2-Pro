  "question": "You are studying the KRAS-BRAF interaction in HEK293T cells overexpressing FLAG-KRAS-G12V and HA-BRAF (PDB: 1UWH shows wild-type BRAF structure). Your co-immunoprecipitation protocol: lyse in NP-40 buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, protease inhibitors), immunoprecipitate with anti-FLAG M2 beads 2h at 4°C, wash 3× with lysis buffer, elute with 2× Laemmli sample buffer, western blot with anti-HA. **Result:** Strong FLAG-KRAS band in IP input and IP lanes (anti-FLAG blot). But anti-HA western shows strong BRAF band in input but NO band in the IP lane. Positive control (cells expressing FLAG-BRAF alone, IP with anti-FLAG) works fine. What is the most likely reason for failing to co-IP BRAF with KRAS?",
  "ideal": "The most likely issue is that **KRAS-BRAF interaction requires GTP loading, and you are not preserving the active GTP-bound state during lysis.** Although KRAS-G12V is constitutively active (impaired GTPase activity), the 2-hour incubation at 4°C in lysis buffer allows residual GTPase activity and does not include GTPγS to lock KRAS in the active conformation. More critically: **1% NP-40 is too harsh** for this transient signaling complex. The KRAS-BRAF interaction involves the KRAS effector domain (residues 29-40; UniProt P01116 Switch I region at 29-35) binding the BRAF RAS-binding domain, which is a relatively low-affinity interaction (Kd ~0.1-1 µM). 1% NP-40 disrupts this weak interaction during the extended IP. **Fix:** (1) Switch to milder detergent: 0.5% Triton X-100 or 0.1% NP-40, (2) add 100 µM GTPγS and 5mM MgCl₂ to lysis buffer to lock KRAS-GTP, (3) shorten IP to 30–45 minutes, (4) add phosphatase inhibitors (the interaction is partly stabilized by BRAF phosphorylation).",
