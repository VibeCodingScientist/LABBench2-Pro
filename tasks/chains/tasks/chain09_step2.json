  "question": "[FILL: Present additional data that supports one interpretation.\nExample: 'Follow-up experiments show: 1) Annexin V staining: 45% of treated cells are apoptotic vs 3% control. 2) Caspase-3 activity assay: 8-fold increase in treated cells. 3) Pre-treatment with Z-VAD-FMK (pan-caspase inhibitor) eliminates the 25 kDa band. Does this resolve which of your hypotheses was correct? What does this mean for using GAPDH as a loading control in this experiment?']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Updated conclusion + practical implication.\nExample: 'This confirms caspase-3-mediated GAPDH cleavage during treatment-induced apoptosis. The Z-VAD-FMK rescue is definitive — blocking caspases eliminates the cleavage product. Critical practical implication: GAPDH is NOT a valid loading control for this experiment because the treatment itself degrades GAPDH. The apparent loading differences between lanes may be artifacts. Should switch to a caspase-resistant loading control (total protein stain like Ponceau S, or a membrane protein like Na/K-ATPase).']",
