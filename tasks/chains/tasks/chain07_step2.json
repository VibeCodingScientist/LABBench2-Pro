  "question": "[FILL: Ask the model to design experiments to discriminate between its hypotheses.\nExample: 'You proposed several explanations for the ZEB1-KO migration paradox. Design ONE experiment that would definitively distinguish between the ZEB2-compensation hypothesis and the collective-vs-single-cell migration hypothesis. Specify the assay, controls, and expected results for each scenario.']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Discriminating experiment.\nExample: 'Transwell/Boyden chamber invasion assay through Matrigel (3D invasion, not 2D sheet migration). If ZEB2 compensation: ZEB1-KO cells should ALSO show increased invasion (ZEB2 drives both migration and invasion). If collective migration: ZEB1-KO cells should show DECREASED invasion (they lost mesenchymal phenotype, gain sheet migration but lose invasive capacity). Controls: WT cells, ZEB1-KO, ZEB1/ZEB2 double KO (tests compensation directly). Western blot for ZEB2, E-cadherin, vimentin to confirm EMT status.']",
