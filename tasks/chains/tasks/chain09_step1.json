  "question": "You are studying the effect of staurosporine (1 µM, 6h) on AKT phosphorylation in Jurkat T-cells. Your western blot for the loading control GAPDH (expected MW: 36 kDa) shows:\n- Lane 1 (DMSO vehicle): Single strong band at ~37 kDa\n- Lane 2 (Staurosporine 1 µM): Strong band at ~37 kDa + unexpected additional band at ~25 kDa (~30% intensity of full-length)\n- Lane 3 (Media-only control): Single strong band at ~37 kDa\n\nThe anti-GAPDH antibody is monoclonal (clone 6C5, epitope in N-terminal domain). List at least 3 possible explanations for the 25 kDa band in lane 2, ranked by likelihood. What single additional experiment would most efficiently distinguish between them?",
  "ideal": "**Ranked explanations:**\n\n1. **(Most likely) Caspase-mediated GAPDH cleavage.** Staurosporine is a potent inducer of apoptosis in Jurkat cells (activates caspase-3/7 within 2-4h). GAPDH is a known caspase-3 substrate, cleaved at **Asp238**, producing an N-terminal fragment of ~25 kDa and a C-terminal fragment of ~11 kDa. Since the antibody (clone 6C5) recognizes the N-terminal domain, it detects both full-length (37 kDa) and the N-terminal cleavage fragment (25 kDa). The ~30% cleavage is consistent with partial apoptosis at 6h.\n\n2. **(Possible) Non-specific cross-reactivity.** The 25 kDa band could be a staurosporine-induced protein that cross-reacts with the antibody. However, monoclonal clone 6C5 is highly specific and widely validated, making this unlikely. Also, the band would need to be staurosporine-inducible, which is a coincidence.\n\n3. **(Less likely) Alternative translation/splicing.** An alternative GAPDH transcript could produce a smaller isoform. However, this would be present in all lanes, not only staurosporine-treated.\n\n4. **(Unlikely) Degradation artifact.** Sample degradation during lysis. However, all lanes were processed identically and only lane 2 shows the extra band.\n\n**Distinguishing experiment:** Add **Z-VAD-FMK** (pan-caspase inhibitor, 50 µM, 1h pre-treatment) before staurosporine. If the 25 kDa band is caspase-mediated cleavage, Z-VAD-FMK will abolish it. If it's non-specific or an isoform, Z-VAD-FMK will have no effect. This single experiment distinguishes hypothesis 1 from all others.",
