  "question": "Based on your analysis — compound X has poor BBB penetration explaining orthotopic failure, moderate potency only at high target expression — design a definitive experiment that either rescues compound X for glioma or definitively kills the program. Specify: model, groups, sample sizes, endpoints, analysis plan, and decision criteria.",
  "ideal": "**Two-arm experiment testing whether the pharmacology problem is solvable:**\n\n**Arm 1 — BBB bypass (proof-of-mechanism):**\n- Model: BT142 orthotopic xenograft in nude mice\n- Groups (n=15 each): (a) Vehicle IP, (b) Compound X 50mg/kg BID oral, (c) Compound X 10mg/kg direct intracranial infusion via osmotic minipump (Alzet), (d) Ivosidenib 50mg/kg BID oral (positive control)\n- Endpoints: 2-HG in tumor (LC-MS/MS at sacrifice day 28), tumor volume (MRI days 0, 14, 28), survival\n- **Decision criterion:** If intracranial compound X (Arm c) reduces 2-HG >70% and tumor volume >30% but oral (Arm b) does not → pharmacology is valid, invest in BBB-penetrant analog. If intracranial also fails → target engagement insufficient even with adequate exposure → kill compound X.\n\n**Arm 2 — Peripheral IDH1 tumor (backup indication):**\n- Model: ICC (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) patient-derived xenograft with endogenous IDH1-R132H, subcutaneous\n- Groups (n=12): Vehicle, Compound X 25/50/100 mg/kg BID, Ivosidenib 150mg/kg QD\n- Endpoints: 2-HG, tumor volume, PK at each dose\n- **Decision criterion:** Compound X must achieve comparable 2-HG reduction and tumor response to ivosidenib at tolerable doses to justify further development.\n\n**Analysis:** Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-hoc (vs. vehicle). Pre-registered protocol. Pre-specify that the program stops if Arm 1c fails.",
