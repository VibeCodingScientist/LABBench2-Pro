  "question": "A 2021 study in *Nature* (LaRochelle et al.) found that the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by *PTPN11*; PDB: 2SHP) exists in an autoinhibited conformation where the N-SH2 domain occludes the catalytic PTP domain. Binding of bisphosphorylated peptides from receptors like PDGFR releases autoinhibition, increasing catalytic activity >50-fold. What is the structural mechanism of SHP2 autoinhibition, and why does the gain-of-function mutation E76K (found in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia) bypass this regulation?",
  "ideal": "In the autoinhibited state, the D'E loop of the N-SH2 domain inserts into the PTP active site, blocking substrate access. The E76 residue forms a salt bridge with K366 in the PTP domain that stabilizes this closed conformation. The E76K mutation eliminates this salt bridge and introduces charge repulsion (both now lysine), destabilizing the autoinhibited state and shifting the equilibrium toward the open, constitutively active form. This results in hyperactive RAS-MAPK signaling independent of upstream receptor activation.",
