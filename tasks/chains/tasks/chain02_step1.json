  "question": "The crystal structure of the EGFR kinase domain bound to erlotinib (PDB: 1M17) was solved by X-ray diffraction. The EGFR kinase domain adopts an active conformation. How many protein chains are in the asymmetric unit? Identify the gatekeeper residue and the key residues forming the ATP-binding pocket that make direct contacts with erlotinib. Why is the gatekeeper residue clinically important?",
  "ideal": "The asymmetric unit contains **one** protein chain (chain A). The gatekeeper residue is **Thr790** (T790). Erlotinib binds in the ATP-binding cleft, forming: (1) a hydrogen bond from the quinazoline N1 to the backbone NH of **Met793** in the hinge region, (2) the aniline ring extends toward the hydrophobic back pocket near **Leu788** and **Thr854**, and (3) the ethynyl-phenyl group points toward solvent. The gatekeeper T790 is clinically critical because the T790M mutation introduces a bulkier methionine side chain that sterically clashes with erlotinib and increases ATP affinity ~5-fold, conferring resistance in ~60% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progress on first-generation TKIs. (Source: Open Targets EGFR-NSCLC association score = 0.885.)",
