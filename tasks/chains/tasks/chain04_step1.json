  "question": "[FILL: Present a claim with incomplete evidence and ask if it's supported.\nExample: 'A preprint claims that drug X reduces tumor growth by 40% in mice (n=5 per group, p=0.048). The study used a single tumor cell line (4T1) implanted subcutaneously. Is this sufficient evidence to conclude drug X is an effective anti-cancer agent?']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Critical evaluation.\nExample: 'No. Major limitations: 1) Marginal significance (p=0.048) with n=5 is fragile — a single outlier could flip the result. 2) Single cell line in one tumor type — no evidence of generalizability. 3) Subcutaneous xenograft may not reflect orthotopic tumor biology. 4) No dose-response relationship shown. This is preliminary evidence warranting further investigation, not a conclusion.']",
