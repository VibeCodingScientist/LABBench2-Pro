  "question": "A consanguineous family presents with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism (onset age 28–32 in two siblings). Whole-exome sequencing reveals both affected siblings are homozygous for PINK1 c.926G>A (p.Gly309Asp). ClinVar lists 87 pathogenic PINK1 variants associated with young adult-onset Parkinsonism (Open Targets association score: 0.838). UniProt (Q9BXM7) annotates PINK1 as a serine/threonine kinase with the kinase domain spanning residues 156–511, active site at Asp362, and ATP-binding residues at 162–170 and 186. What is the normal function of PINK1 in mitochondrial quality control, and how would the Gly309Asp mutation within the kinase domain be expected to cause disease?",
  "ideal": "PINK1 is a mitochondrial-targeted serine/threonine kinase that acts as a sensor of mitochondrial damage. Under normal conditions, PINK1 is imported into healthy mitochondria and rapidly degraded by PARL protease. When mitochondrial membrane potential collapses (ΔΨm loss), PINK1 import stalls, causing it to accumulate on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). There, PINK1 autophosphorylates and then phosphorylates both ubiquitin (at Ser65) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin (at Ser65 of its Ubl domain), activating Parkin's ubiquitin ligase activity. Activated Parkin ubiquitinates OMM proteins (MFN1/2, VDAC, Miro), recruiting autophagy receptors (NDP52, OPTN) for mitophagy — the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria.\n\n**Gly309Asp impact:** Gly309 is in the activation loop of the kinase domain (within the 156–511 kinase domain, near the DFG motif critical for kinase activation). Glycine's flexibility allows the activation loop to adopt the conformations needed for catalysis. Aspartate at this position introduces: (1) a bulky, charged side chain causing steric clash that rigidifies the activation loop, (2) disruption of the DFG motif positioning needed for Mg²⁺/ATP coordination, and (3) impaired autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation. Loss of PINK1 kinase activity → failure to activate Parkin → accumulation of damaged mitochondria → chronic oxidative stress → selective death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (which have high metabolic demand and low antioxidant capacity).",
