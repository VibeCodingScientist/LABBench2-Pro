  "question": "Gly309 is located in the activation loop of the PINK1 kinase domain. The activation loop in kinases must undergo a conformational change from the \"DFG-out\" (inactive) to \"DFG-in\" (active) state for catalysis. What specific structural consequences would you predict for the G309D mutation? How would you experimentally confirm the structural and functional impact? Propose 3 complementary experiments with expected results for both WT and G309D PINK1.",
  "ideal": "**Predicted structural consequences:**\n- G309D introduces steric clash in the activation loop, preventing the DFG-in conformation needed for ATP positioning and substrate access\n- The aspartate's negative charge may create electrostatic repulsion with nearby acidic residues (Asp362 at the active site), destabilizing the catalytic architecture\n- The mutation likely reduces thermal stability of the kinase domain by introducing strain in a conformational hinge region\n\n**Three experiments:**\n1. **Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF/Thermal shift):** Express and purify PINK1 kinase domain (residues 156–511) WT and G309D from insect cells. Measure Tm in presence/absence of ATP analog (AMP-PNP). **Expected:** WT Tm ~48°C, +4°C with AMP-PNP (ligand stabilization). G309D Tm ~42°C (destabilized), minimal shift with AMP-PNP (cannot bind ATP properly).\n\n2. **In vitro kinase assay:** Measure phosphorylation of ubiquitin-Ser65 (the physiological substrate) using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE or anti-pSer65-Ub antibody. **Expected:** WT shows robust ubiquitin phosphorylation (Km_ATP ~50 µM); G309D shows <5% of WT activity, with dramatically increased Km_ATP (>500 µM) reflecting disrupted ATP binding.\n\n3. **Cellular mitophagy assay:** Express WT or G309D PINK1 in PINK1-KO HeLa cells, treat with CCCP (10 µM, 2h) to depolarize mitochondria. Measure Parkin recruitment (GFP-Parkin translocation to mitochondria by confocal) and mitophagy (mt-Keima or mitoQC reporter). **Expected:** WT: >80% cells show Parkin translocation; G309D: <10%, similar to PINK1-KO. Mitophagy flux reduced >5-fold in G309D.",
