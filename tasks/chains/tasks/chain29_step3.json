  "ideal": "**This is a remarkably coherent biological picture of the \"stem-like\" CD8+ T cell state that predicts immunotherapy response:**\n\n**1. Wnt/β-catenin signaling (NES +2.8, responders):** TCF7 (encoding TCF-1, the master transcription factor of progenitor-exhausted T cells) heads the leading edge. TCF-1+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cells represent the \"stem-like\" reservoir that self-renews AND differentiates into effector cells upon PD-1 blockade. This is arguably THE key finding — responders have more Wnt-active, self-renewing T cell progenitors that can mount a sustained anti-tumor response when unleashed by anti-PD-1.\n\n**2. OXPHOS up + Glycolysis down (responders):** Progenitor-exhausted T cells rely on mitochondrial OXPHOS for energy (like memory T cells), whereas terminally exhausted T cells shift to glycolysis (like effector T cells in metabolic crisis). The metabolic profile of responder T cells is **metabolically fit** — they have functional mitochondria supporting long-term survival and self-renewal.\n\n**3. Exhaustion signature DOWN (responders):** Lower expression of exhaustion markers (PD-1, LAG-3, CD39/ENTPD1, TIM-3) in responders' progenitor-exhausted cells. This seems paradoxical — these cells are defined by being PD-1+ — but the DEGREE of exhaustion marker expression matters. Responders' progenitor cells express moderate PD-1 (enough to define them) but haven't progressed to the terminal exhaustion state with multi-marker co-expression (PD-1+++/LAG-3+/TIM-3+/CD39+).\n\n**4. IFN-γ response (modestly enriched in responders):** Indicates these cells are capable of responding to inflammatory signals — they're not anergic. However, the modest enrichment (NES 1.6, FDR 0.045) suggests this is a readiness state, not active IFN-γ production.\n\n**Integrated model:** Responders harbor a larger reservoir of metabolically fit, Wnt-active, self-renewing CD8+ T cell progenitors that haven't terminally differentiated. Anti-PD-1 therapy specifically expands this population — without sufficient progenitors, there's nothing to expand, explaining non-response.\n\n**Clinical translation:** TCF7+ CD8+ T cell frequency in pre-treatment biopsies could serve as a predictive biomarker for anti-PD-1 response. Several retrospective studies support this (Sade-Feldman et al., Cell 2018). Prospective validation needed.",
