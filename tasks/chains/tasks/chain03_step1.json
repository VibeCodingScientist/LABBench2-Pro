For each of 20,000 genes, you have normalized read counts. What statistical test should you use to identify differentially expressed genes, and why?']",

A paired/matched design should be used since samples are matched tumor-normal pairs. A simple t-test would be inappropriate because count data violates normality assumptions.']",
