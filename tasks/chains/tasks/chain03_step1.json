  "question": "You have RNA-seq data from 15 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors and 15 matched adjacent normal tissues (same patient). Library prep: polyA-selected, 150bp PE, ~40M reads/sample. After alignment (STAR) and quantification (featureCounts), you have a raw count matrix of 22,487 genes × 30 samples. What statistical method should you use for differential expression analysis? Justify your choice, considering: (a) the data distribution, (b) the paired design, (c) potential confounders, and (d) why simpler approaches fail.",
  "ideal": "Use **DESeq2** (or equivalently edgeR) with a **negative binomial generalized linear model** including patient as a blocking factor. Justification: (a) RNA-seq counts follow an overdispersed Poisson → negative binomial distribution; variance is not proportional to mean, ruling out Poisson models. (b) The paired design (tumor vs. normal from same patient) must be modeled: `design = ~ patient + condition` — this controls for inter-individual variation and increases power. (c) Include batch if samples were sequenced in multiple runs; can model with surrogate variable analysis (svaseq) if hidden confounders suspected. (d) **t-tests fail** because they assume normality on continuous data and cannot handle count-specific mean-variance relationships. Log-transforming and running t-tests loses information at low counts and violates variance stabilization assumptions. Limma-voom is acceptable as an alternative (applies precision weights to log-CPM), especially with >15 samples where the normal approximation holds.",
