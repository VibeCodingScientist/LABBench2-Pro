  "question": "[FILL: Ask for therapeutic strategy based on the mechanism.\nExample: 'Given that PINK1 G309D likely has reduced kinase activity and impaired mitophagy, propose two distinct therapeutic strategies: one targeting the PINK1-Parkin pathway directly, and one targeting downstream consequences. For each, name a specific drug or compound class and explain the rationale.']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Two therapeutic strategies.\nExample: '1) Direct pathway rescue: Kinetin triphosphate (KTP), a neo-substrate that can be phosphorylated by even partially active PINK1, activating Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Rationale: bypasses the reduced kinase activity by providing an easier substrate. 2) Downstream: Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (MitoQ or SS-31/elamipretide) to reduce ROS from accumulated damaged mitochondria. Rationale: addresses the proximate cause of neuronal death while the underlying mitophagy defect persists.']",
