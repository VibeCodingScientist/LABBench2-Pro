  "question": "Given that osimertinib's efficacy depends on covalent bonding to Cys797 and C797S resistance eliminates this, a fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor must work without covalent Cys797 binding. Which design strategy would MOST likely yield a potent inhibitor of EGFR harboring L858R/T790M/C797S triple-mutant?\nA) Increase the reactivity of the acrylamide warhead to form a covalent bond with nearby Lys745 instead\nB) Design a reversible inhibitor with high shape complementarity to the mutant binding pocket, exploiting the unique conformation created by the triple mutation\nC) Add a PEG linker to extend the molecule into the allosteric pocket behind the αC-helix\nD) Replace the pyrimidine scaffold with a large macrocyclic peptide that binds outside the ATP pocket",
