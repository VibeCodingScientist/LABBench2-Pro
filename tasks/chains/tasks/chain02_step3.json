  "ideal": "[FILL: The correct answer with reasoning.\nExample: 'C) Extending into the hydrophobic pocket. The zinc coordination (sulfonamide) and H-bonding (Thr199) are already optimized. The hydrophobic pocket offers the most room for additional favorable contacts. B would lose the critical N-Zn bond. A would add minimal contacts. D would be unfavorable in the hydrophobic environment.']",
