  "ideal": "**The interferon signal is likely real, not an artifact.** Evidence: (1) **Independent convergence:** GWAS loci enriched for interferon genes AND Open Targets independently identifies IFNAR1/2 as top T2D associations from orthogonal data (genetic associations, expression, literature). This convergence from different methodologies strongly supports a genuine signal. (2) **Biological plausibility:** Type I interferons (IFNα/β) are increasingly recognized in T2D pathogenesis. IFN signaling in pancreatic beta cells induces ER stress and apoptosis, contributing to beta cell loss. In obesity, chronic low-grade inflammation involves IFN-stimulated gene expression in adipose tissue macrophages. Viral infections triggering IFN responses are linked to diabetes onset (enterovirus → type 1 diabetes; HCV → T2D). (3) **Statistical robustness:** p = 1.4×10⁻⁷ with 19 genes and 2.8× enrichment is highly significant and well above the marginal pathway results.\n\n**However, consider potential confounds:** The IFNAR1/IFNAR2 locus on chromosome 21q22 is in a region with complex LD and multiple genes. The T2D signal may reflect LD with nearby genes (e.g., IL10RB) rather than IFNAR itself. Fine-mapping with ancestry-specific LD (leveraging the African cohort's short LD blocks) is needed to distinguish causal genes.\n\n**Biological ranking:** (1) Insulin secretion + beta cell development = core T2D pathophysiology; (2) Interferon signaling + adipocyte differentiation = immune/metabolic crosstalk; (3) Circadian rhythm = plausible (sleep disruption → insulin resistance); (4) Mitochondrial transport = marginal (p=0.012, low enrichment).",
