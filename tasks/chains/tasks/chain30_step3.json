  "question": "Based on your synthesis — diversity predicts response, antibiotics harm response, specific species don't replicate — design a trial that definitively tests whether microbiome manipulation improves anti-PD-1 efficacy. Include: intervention, control, patient population, endpoints, and how you address the key confounders (antibiotics, diet, geography).",
  "ideal": "**MICRO-PD1: Microbiome Intervention for Cancer Response Optimization**\n\n**Design:** Phase II, randomized, double-blind, 2×2 factorial, multi-center (10 sites across 3 countries to capture geographic diversity)\n\n**Population:** Treatment-naive advanced melanoma (BRAF V600E or WT), planned for pembrolizumab monotherapy. n=400 (100 per arm). Exclude: antibiotic use within 60 days, active GI disease, prior immunotherapy.\n\n**Factor 1 — Microbiome intervention:**\n- Arm A: Screened healthy-donor FMT (oral capsules, 30 capsules over 3 days, pre-pembrolizumab)\n- Arm B: Placebo capsules (autologous stool, processed identically)\n\n**Factor 2 — Antibiotic avoidance:**\n- Arm X: Strict antibiotic stewardship protocol (avoid all antibiotics during first 12 weeks; treat infections with narrowest-spectrum agent if absolutely necessary; document all violations)\n- Arm Y: Standard of care (no antibiotic restrictions)\n\n**Four arms:** FMT+stewardship (AX), FMT+standard (AY), Placebo+stewardship (BX), Placebo+standard (BY)\n\n**Primary endpoint:** Objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1 at 24 weeks.\n**Key secondary:** PFS, Shannon diversity change from baseline to week 6, CD8+ TIL density change (paired biopsies at baseline and week 6), circulating T cell clonality (TCRseq).\n\n**Confounder control:**\n1. **Antibiotics:** Factor 2 directly tests this. All antibiotic use recorded in real-time diary.\n2. **Diet:** Standardized dietary guidance (high-fiber, Mediterranean-style) for all arms. Food frequency questionnaire at weeks 0, 6, 12. Diet is a confounder to measure, not a separate intervention (would require 2×2×2 design = 800 patients).\n3. **Geography:** Stratify randomization by country. Include site as random effect in mixed models.\n\n**Biological sampling:**\n- Stool: weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 24 → shotgun metagenomics + metabolomics\n- Blood: weeks 0, 6, 12 → CyTOF (immune phenotyping), plasma metabolomics\n- Tumor: weeks 0, 6 → IHC (CD8, PD-L1, FoxP3) + spatial transcriptomics\n\n**Decision criteria:**\n- FMT improves ORR by ≥15% absolute (40→55%): proceed to Phase III\n- Antibiotic stewardship improves ORR by ≥10%: publish clinical guideline\n- If FMT shows no benefit but antibiotic stewardship does: the signal is about PRESERVATION of existing diversity, not transplantation of new diversity\n- If neither works: microbiome manipulation is insufficient, and the microbiome-immunotherapy association is correlative/confounded\n\n**Analysis:** Primary: logistic regression with FMT and stewardship as main effects + interaction term. Test interaction to determine whether FMT + stewardship is synergistic (maintaining diversity of transplanted microbiome requires avoiding antibiotics). Secondary: mediation analysis with Shannon diversity as mediator between treatment and response.",
