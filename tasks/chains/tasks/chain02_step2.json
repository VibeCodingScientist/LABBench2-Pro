What is the key interaction with the zinc ion?']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Binding mechanism.\nExample: 'The sulfonamide NH group displaces the zinc-bound water/hydroxide, forming a direct N-Zn coordination bond. The sulfonamide oxygen atoms form hydrogen bonds with Thr199, and the aromatic ring makes hydrophobic contacts with the pocket.']",
