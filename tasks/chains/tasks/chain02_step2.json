  "question": "Given the EGFR-erlotinib binding mode you described (hinge hydrogen bond to Met793, gatekeeper T790), explain how the third-generation inhibitor osimertinib overcomes T790M resistance. What is the key chemical difference between erlotinib and osimertinib that enables this? What new vulnerability does osimertinib's mechanism create?",
  "ideal": "Osimertinib overcomes T790M through two mechanisms: (1) **It is designed to accommodate methionine** at position 790 — the pyrimidine core is smaller than erlotinib's quinazoline and the binding pose avoids steric clash with the bulkier M790 side chain. (2) **It forms an irreversible covalent bond** with **Cys797** in the solvent-exposed region of the ATP site via a Michael acceptor acrylamide warhead. This covalent bond compensates for reduced non-covalent affinity against T790M. The vulnerability this creates: the **C797S** tertiary mutation eliminates the cysteine nucleophile required for covalent binding, ablating osimertinib's potency. C797S is the dominant mechanism of acquired resistance to osimertinib in ~10-15% of progressing patients. When C797S occurs in *trans* with T790M, the cancer remains sensitive to combination first + third-gen TKIs; in *cis*, neither works alone.",
