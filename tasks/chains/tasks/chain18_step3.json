  "question": "Mpro resistance mutations are emerging. The E166V mutation in Mpro reduces nirmatrelvir IC50 from ~1 nM to ~50-100 nM but also reduces viral fitness (Mpro catalytic efficiency drops ~3-fold). Which of the following drug design strategies would BEST address nirmatrelvir resistance while maintaining pan-coronavirus potential?\nA) Increase the reactivity of the nitrile warhead to form a more stable covalent bond\nB) Design a non-covalent inhibitor with extended interactions into the S3/S4 pockets that are distal from position 166\nC) Develop a PROTAC that recruits a human E3 ligase to degrade Mpro — since Mpro is a viral protein, any ubiquitination would be productive\nD) Switch to an allosteric inhibitor targeting the Mpro dimer interface",
