  "question": "Three additional studies have since been published on the same 10-gene ctDNA methylation panel for stage I NSCLC detection:\n\n| Study | Design | N (cases+controls) | Sites | AUC | Sensitivity @95% Spec |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| C | Prospective cohort | 180+360 | 3 | 0.79 | 52% |\n| D | Retrospective | 95+190 | 1 | 0.88 | 71% |\n| E | Prospective cohort | 650+1300 | 8 | 0.71 | 38% |\n\nTogether with Papers A (AUC=0.92, n=481) and B (AUC=0.68, n=3300): (a) What is your best estimate of the true AUC? (b) What statistical pattern is evident across all 5 studies? (c) How would you formally combine these results, and what method-specific issues apply? (d) If you generated a funnel plot, what would you expect to see?",
  "ideal": "**(a) Best estimate of true AUC: ~0.70-0.73.** Weight heavily toward the larger, prospective, multi-center studies (B and E). A sample-size-weighted average gives approximately: (0.92×481 + 0.68×3300 + 0.79×540 + 0.88×285 + 0.71×1950) / (481+3300+540+285+1950) ≈ 0.72.\n\n**(b) Clear small-study effect / inverse correlation between sample size and AUC:**\n- n=285 → AUC 0.88\n- n=481 → AUC 0.92\n- n=540 → AUC 0.79\n- n=1950 → AUC 0.71\n- n=3300 → AUC 0.68\n\nSmaller studies show systematically higher AUC. This is the classic pattern of **publication bias and/or overfitting** — small studies with impressive results get published; small studies with modest results don't. Additionally, single-center studies (Papers A, D) outperform multi-center ones (B, C, E), suggesting the performance boost reflects controlled conditions, not generalizable signal.\n\n**(c) Formal meta-analysis approach:**\n- Use a **bivariate random-effects model** (Reitsma model) that jointly models sensitivity and specificity, since they are correlated via the threshold effect\n- Transform AUC or use paired sensitivity/specificity at the common 95% specificity threshold\n- Report **pooled sensitivity at 95% specificity** with 95% CI from the random-effects model\n- Expect high heterogeneity: I² likely >75%, with τ² reflecting genuine between-study variation\n- **Issue:** AUC pooling is problematic because AUC is a summary measure across all thresholds. Pooling sensitivity at a fixed specificity is preferred for clinical interpretation.\n\n**(d) Funnel plot expectation:** Plot study precision (1/SE or √n) on y-axis vs. effect size (AUC or log-DOR) on x-axis. Expected: **asymmetric funnel** — small studies (bottom) skewed toward high AUC (right), while large studies (top) cluster around AUC 0.70. A formal test (Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test for diagnostic studies) would likely be significant (p<0.05), confirming publication bias / small-study effects.",
