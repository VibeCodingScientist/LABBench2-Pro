  "question": "Design a 4-step preclinical validation plan for your reversible fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor lead compound targeting L858R/T790M/C797S. Include: (1) biochemical potency, (2) cellular efficacy, (3) selectivity, and (4) in vivo proof of concept. Specify assays, cell lines, and key success criteria.",
  "ideal": "(1) **Biochemical:** Caliper mobility-shift kinase assay measuring IC50 against recombinant EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S, plus WT and single/double mutant panel. Success: IC50 <10 nM against triple mutant, >100-fold selectivity over WT EGFR. (2) **Cellular:** Ba/F3 cells engineered with EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S (IL-3 independent growth), measure proliferation inhibition (CellTiter-Glo). Also test in patient-derived NSCLC cell lines with confirmed triple mutation (if available). Success: EC50 <100 nM, complete pathway suppression (pEGFR western). (3) **Selectivity:** KINOMEscan or similar panel against 468 kinases at 1 µM. Calculate selectivity score S(10). Key off-targets to monitor: ERBB2, ERBB4, BLK, BMX (kinases with Cys at gatekeeper+6 position). Success: S(10) <0.05. (4) **In vivo:** Ba/F3 EGFR triple-mutant subcutaneous xenograft in nude mice, BID oral dosing, 21-day study. Success: >60% tumor growth inhibition, no body weight loss >10%. Include osimertinib as negative control (expected inactive) and vehicle.",
