Include: synthesis approach, binding assay, and selectivity assessment against the 12 other human CA isoforms.']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Concrete experimental plan.\nExample: '1) Synthesis: Couple 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide with biphenyl-4-boronic acid via Suzuki coupling to extend into the pocket. 2) Binding: Measure Ki using a CO2 hydration stopped-flow assay (Khalifah method) comparing parent vs. extended compound against CA-II. 3) Selectivity: Profile against CA-I, CA-IV, CA-IX, CA-XII panel using the same assay — the hydrophobic pocket varies across isoforms, so selectivity is expected.']",
