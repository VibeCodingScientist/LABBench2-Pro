  "question": "Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) produces durable responses in ~20-30% of patients across multiple cancer types. However, ~10-15% of patients experience **hyperprogressive disease (HPD)** — tumor growth rate accelerates ≥2-fold after starting anti-PD-1, faster than pre-treatment kinetics. The crystal structure of PD-1/PD-L1 complex (PDB: 4ZQK, resolution 2.45 Å) shows the extracellular interaction interface. ClinVar lists 1,705 pathogenic TP53 variants and 1,922 pathogenic PTEN variants, both of which are enriched in HPD tumors. Propose at least 3 mechanistic hypotheses for how blocking PD-1 (which should release anti-tumor immunity) paradoxically accelerates tumor growth. Rank by evidence strength.",
  "ideal": "**Hypothesis 1 (Strongest evidence): PD-1 blockade activates regulatory T cells (Tregs) and immunosuppressive populations.** PD-1 is expressed not only on effector CD8+ T cells but also on Tregs, exhausted CD4+ cells, and macrophages. In tumors where Tregs constitute a large fraction of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-1 blockade may disproportionately activate Tregs (which suppress anti-tumor immunity) over effectors. If the Treg:effector ratio is unfavorable, net immunosuppression increases. Evidence: HPD correlates with high pre-treatment Treg infiltration and FoxP3+ expansion after anti-PD-1.\n\n**Hypothesis 2 (Moderate evidence): PD-1 blockade on macrophages promotes M2 polarization and tumor-promoting inflammation.** Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) express PD-1; PD-1 signaling restrains their phagocytic activity but also limits inflammatory cytokine production. Blocking PD-1 on TAMs may shift them toward an M2-like program producing growth factors (VEGF, EGF, TGF-β) and matrix metalloproteinases that promote invasion. This is context-dependent — in some tumors, PD-1 blockade enhances phagocytosis (beneficial); in others, it may trigger a wound-healing inflammatory cascade (detrimental).\n\n**Hypothesis 3 (Emerging evidence): Fc-receptor-mediated antibody effects.** Anti-PD-1 antibodies (IgG4 for pembrolizumab, IgG4 for nivolumab) can engage Fc receptors on macrophages. In some contexts, this may: (a) induce ADCP (antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis) of PD-1+ effector T cells, depleting them; (b) trigger Fc-mediated crosslinking of inhibitory receptors on myeloid cells. The net effect is depletion of the very effector cells needed for anti-tumor immunity, while leaving tumor cells untouched.\n\n**Hypothesis 4 (Correlative): Genomic context — MDM2/MDM4 amplification or EGFR mutation.** HPD is enriched in tumors with MDM2 amplification, EGFR mutations, and specific TP53 mutations. MDM2 amplification may create a tumor-intrinsic feedback: immune checkpoint blockade induces IFN-γ, which upregulates PD-L1 via JAK-STAT. In MDM2-amplified tumors, IFN-γ signaling may paradoxically activate MDM2 through an IRF-dependent mechanism, promoting p53 degradation and accelerating proliferation.",
