  "question": "You want to test whether the E76K mutation shifts the EC50 for peptide-induced SHP2 activation compared to wild-type. You will measure phosphatase activity at 8 peptide concentrations (0–50 µM), 4 biological replicates per condition, for both WT and E76K SHP2. You expect E76K to have a lower EC50 (left-shifted curve) and possibly higher basal activity. What is the appropriate statistical framework to compare the dose-response curves and specifically test for EC50 differences?",
  "ideal": "Fit four-parameter log-logistic dose-response models (bottom, top, EC50, Hill slope) to each dataset using nonlinear least-squares regression (e.g., `drc` package in R or `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`). Compare models using an extra-sum-of-squares F-test: fit a shared model (same EC50 for both) vs. separate models (different EC50s). The F-test p-value tells you whether allowing separate EC50s significantly improves the fit. Report EC50 ± 95% CI for each variant. Do **not** use t-tests on individual concentrations — this ignores the dose-response structure and inflates multiple comparisons. For the basal activity comparison specifically (0 µM), a Welch's t-test on the 4 replicates is appropriate.",
