  "question": "A protein was identified from metagenomic sequencing of a hydrothermal vent-adjacent cold seep organism (*Shewanella benthica* at 4°C, 500 atm, Mariana Trench). The first 120 residues of the protein are:\n```\nMATLKDQLIVNVWQEVDKFGHNITQSSGSILTAFNPETIKIFYAGSSEVDQGKIFADLNRHIGKEPLKIYIAGDNQDKAIAQETADFIRSDLALQTEYVDKLFPIVKEKYGENFDEKFKD\n```\nWhat protein family does this belong to? Identify the key conserved motifs and catalytic residues you would expect based on the sequence.",
  "ideal": "This sequence belongs to the **L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)** family (EC 1.1.1.27). Key identifiers:\n1. **Rossmann fold NAD⁺-binding motif:** The \"GxGxxG\" variant is present in the N-terminal region (~residues 28-33), characteristic of NAD⁺/NADH-dependent oxidoreductases.\n2. **Catalytic residues:** Based on LDH family conservation: **His193** (proton shuttle in catalysis), **Arg169** (substrate carboxylate binding), and **Asp166** (positions the catalytic His). These are numbered based on alignment to canonical LDH.\n3. **Substrate specificity loop:** Residues ~95-110 determine L-lactate vs. L-malate specificity. The presence of Gln at the key position suggests lactate preference (glutamine→arginine switch converts LDH to MDH).\n4. **Mobile loop:** Residues ~95-107 form the \"active site loop\" that closes over the substrate during catalysis.\n\nThe protein would be expected to form a **homotetramer** (typical quaternary structure for bacterial LDH), with each subunit ~35 kDa.",
