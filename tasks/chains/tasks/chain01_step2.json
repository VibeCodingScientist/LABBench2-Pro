  "question": "Given that SHP2 autoinhibition is released by bisphosphorylated peptides, the following dose-response data shows SHP2 phosphatase activity (fold over basal) upon titration of a bisphosphorylated IRS-1 pY1172/pY1222 peptide: [peptide] = 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50 µM; fold-activity = 1.0, 1.2, 2.8, 8.5, 18, 42, 51, 54. The maximum activation plateau is ~54-fold. At what peptide concentration is half-maximal activation achieved? The cellular concentration of IRS-1 phosphopeptide during insulin stimulation is estimated at 0.5–2 µM. Is SHP2 activation likely to be switch-like or graded in cells?",
  "ideal": "Half-maximal activation (~27-fold) occurs between 0.5 and 1 µM peptide, approximately 0.7 µM by interpolation. Since the estimated cellular concentration range (0.5–2 µM) spans the EC50, SHP2 activation in cells is **graded**, not switch-like — small changes in receptor signaling will produce proportional changes in SHP2 activity. This is consistent with SHP2 acting as a signal amplitude modulator rather than a binary switch. A Hill coefficient could be estimated from the data; the steep rise between 0.1–5 µM suggests moderate cooperativity (n_H ≈ 1.5–2).",
