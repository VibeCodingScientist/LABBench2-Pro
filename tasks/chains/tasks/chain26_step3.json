  "question": "A retrospective analysis of VIALE-A trial data stratified by IDH1/IDH2 mutation status (mutations present in ~15% of AML patients, detectable by ClinVar variants: IDH1 35 pathogenic, IDH2 80 pathogenic) reveals: IDH-mutant AML responds exceptionally well to ven+aza (CR rate 75% vs. 65% for IDH-WT). However, when these patients relapse, they lose the IDH mutation (IDH reversion to wild-type) in 40% of cases. This is unusual — most cancers acquire new mutations at relapse, not lose drivers. (a) Explain why IDH-mutant AML is particularly sensitive to venetoclax. (b) Why would relapsed disease LOSE the IDH mutation? (c) What does this mean for salvage therapy?",
  "ideal": "**(a) IDH mutation → venetoclax sensitivity:** IDH1/2 mutations produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite that inhibits the α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV of the ETC). This forces AML cells to rely more heavily on BCL-2 to maintain mitochondrial membrane integrity and prevent apoptosis. BCL-2 dependence is therefore metabolically enforced in IDH-mutant AML. Additionally, 2-HG inhibits TET2 (a DNA demethylase), creating a hypermethylation phenotype that silences pro-apoptotic genes — azacitidine directly reverses this. The combination is mechanistically tailored: azacitidine reverses 2-HG-mediated methylation, restoring apoptotic priming, while venetoclax blocks the compensatory BCL-2 dependence.\n\n**(b) IDH mutation loss at relapse:** The IDH mutation was a **dependency** for the original clone's survival strategy (BCL-2 dependence + differentiation block). Under venetoclax+azacitidine selective pressure, the IDH-mutant clone is preferentially killed. Relapse arises from a **pre-existing IDH-WT subclone** that was a minor population at diagnosis. This IDH-WT subclone survives because it's NOT BCL-2-dependent (uses MCL-1 or BFL-1 instead) and is NOT affected by 2-HG-driven metabolic rewiring. The \"loss\" of IDH mutation is clonal selection, not reversion.\n\n**(c) Implications for salvage therapy:**\n1. **Do NOT add an IDH inhibitor** (ivosidenib/enasidenib) at relapse if the IDH mutation is lost — there's no target.\n2. **The relapsed disease has fundamentally different biology:** It's BCL-2-independent (explaining venetoclax resistance) and may be MCL-1-dependent. Salvage options: (a) MCL-1 inhibitor combinations, (b) conventional intensive chemotherapy if patient is fit, (c) targeted therapy based on whatever driver mutations the relapsed clone carries (re-sequence to identify new targets).\n3. **Clinical implication:** Monitor IDH mutation status AND subclonal architecture at diagnosis using deep NGS (>1% VAF sensitivity). If IDH-WT subclones are detectable at >5% VAF at diagnosis, consider preemptive strategies to address both populations.",
