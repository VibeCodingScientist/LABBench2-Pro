  "question": "After switching to 0.1% NP-40, adding GTPγS/MgCl₂, and reducing IP time to 45 min, you now see: anti-HA blot of FLAG IP shows a strong band at ~87 kDa and a weaker band at ~95 kDa. BRAF's predicted molecular weight is 84.4 kDa. Are these bands consistent with BRAF? What explains the two bands and their different intensities? What additional control would confirm these are specifically BRAF?",
  "ideal": "The **87 kDa band** is consistent with BRAF (predicted 84.4 kDa; proteins typically run slightly above predicted MW on SDS-PAGE due to post-translational modifications and SDS binding variability). The **95 kDa band** is likely **phosphorylated BRAF** — activation loop phosphorylation (at S446, S447, D448, and the critical T599/S602 phosphosites) causes a mobility shift of ~8-10 kDa on standard SDS-PAGE gels, which is a well-documented phenomenon for RAF kinases. The weaker intensity of the 95 kDa band indicates that only a fraction of co-IPed BRAF is in the fully phosphorylated/activated state, consistent with the signaling cascade (KRAS-GTP recruits BRAF, but activation requires additional events including dimerization and phosphorylation).\n\n**Controls to confirm identity:** (1) Treat the IP sample with lambda phosphatase — the 95 kDa band should collapse into the 87 kDa band. (2) Blot with anti-pBRAF-S445 antibody — should label only the upper band. (3) Perform IP from cells expressing FLAG-KRAS-G12V without HA-BRAF — neither band should appear (rules out non-specific HA antibody cross-reactivity).",
