  "question": "Based on your synthesis — FLT3 inhibitors work best with intensive chemotherapy, modestly as monotherapy in R/R, and poorly with low-intensity backbones — a tumor board asks: A 72-year-old patient with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD+ AML (allelic ratio 0.8, NPM1 co-mutation, no adverse cytogenetics) with ECOG PS 1, creatinine 1.4, ejection fraction 50%. Is this patient fit for intensive chemotherapy + FLT3 inhibitor, or should they receive a low-intensity regimen? What FLT3 inhibitor would you recommend and why?",
  "ideal": "**Assessment: This patient is in the \"gray zone\" — potentially fit for intensive therapy with careful evaluation.**\n\n**Favorable factors:** ECOG 1, NPM1 co-mutation (favorable prognosis), no adverse cytogenetics. NPM1+/FLT3-ITD+ with allelic ratio <0.5 is favorable risk; allelic ratio 0.8 shifts to intermediate risk (ELN 2022). Age 72 alone does not preclude intensive therapy.\n\n**Concerning factors:** Age 72 increases treatment-related mortality (TRM) with 7+3 (~10-15% vs. ~5% in younger patients). Creatinine 1.4 suggests mild renal impairment (estimate GFR). EF 50% is borderline for anthracycline use (daunorubicin in 7+3).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n1. **Geriatric assessment** (gait speed, ADLs, Charlson comorbidity index) should guide fitness determination, not age alone.\n2. **If deemed fit:** 7+3 + **midostaurin** (RATIFY-based, FDA-approved front-line) or 7+3 + **quizartinib** (QuANTUM-First, recently approved, more FLT3-selective). Between these: **quizartinib** is preferred because (a) it has higher FLT3 selectivity, (b) it demonstrated improvement in both FLT3-ITD and high allelic ratio subgroups, (c) the survival benefit was clear even in older patients (60-75 subgroup analysis).\n3. **Consider dose-reduced 7+3** (\"5+2\") to mitigate anthracycline cardiac risk given EF 50%.\n4. **If deemed unfit by geriatric assessment:** Venetoclax + azacitidine (standard of care for unfit AML) + consider adding gilteritinib — although LACEWING was negative, venetoclax-based combinations have different synergy biology than azacitidine alone, and ongoing trials are exploring this.\n5. **Plan for maintenance FLT3 inhibitor** after remission — RATIFY showed most benefit was in the maintenance phase.\n6. **Molecular monitoring:** PCR-based FLT3-ITD and NPM1 MRD at cycles 2, 4, and post-consolidation. If MRD-negative for NPM1, excellent prognosis. If MRD-positive, consider allogeneic transplant if fit.\n\n**Do NOT give:** Gilteritinib monotherapy front-line — LACEWING's failure applies even more strongly to monotherapy; reserve gilteritinib for R/R setting where ADMIRAL demonstrated benefit.",
