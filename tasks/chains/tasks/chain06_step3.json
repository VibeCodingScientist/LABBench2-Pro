  "question": "You want to quantify how different KRAS mutations affect BRAF binding efficiency. You will express FLAG-KRAS (WT, G12V, G12C, G12D, G13D, Q61H) with HA-BRAF, perform co-IP under your optimized conditions, and compare the amount of BRAF co-immunoprecipitated. Describe the quantification strategy: normalization, controls, number of replicates, and the correct statistical test. How would you present this data?",
  "ideal": "**Quantification:** Densitometry of anti-HA (BRAF) and anti-FLAG (KRAS) bands using ImageJ/ImageStudio. Calculate **binding efficiency ratio** = (HA-BRAF band intensity in IP) / (FLAG-KRAS band intensity in IP) for each mutant. This normalizes for IP efficiency differences.\n\n**Essential controls:** (1) Input blots for both FLAG-KRAS and HA-BRAF to confirm equal expression across conditions. (2) Empty vector FLAG-IP (background subtraction). (3) FLAG-KRAS-S17N (dominant-negative, GDP-locked) as negative control — should show minimal BRAF binding.\n\n**Replicates:** Minimum 4 biological replicates (independent transfections on different days). All 6 mutants + WT + S17N run on the same blot per replicate to minimize blot-to-blot variability.\n\n**Statistical test:** One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-hoc test comparing each mutant to WT-KRAS. Check normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and homoscedasticity (Levene's test) on the ratio data; if violated, use Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post-hoc. With 8 groups and 4 replicates, report effect sizes (fold-change vs. WT) alongside p-values.\n\n**Presentation:** Bar graph showing mean binding efficiency ratio ± SEM for each KRAS variant, ordered by binding strength. Include individual data points overlaid (n=4 is too few for box plots). Include a representative western blot panel below the quantification graph. Report: \"G12V showed 4.2±0.6-fold enrichment of BRAF compared to WT (p=0.003, Dunnett's test).\"",
