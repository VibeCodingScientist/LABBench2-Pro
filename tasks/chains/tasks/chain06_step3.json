  "question": "[FILL: Ask for a quantitative follow-up based on the result.\nExample: 'You want to quantify the ERK1/2 phosphorylation ratio across a time course (0, 5, 15, 30, 60 min after EGF stimulation). You will have 3 biological replicates per time point. Describe the quantification approach and the statistical test to determine which time point has peak activation.']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Quantification + stats plan.\nExample: 'Quantify band intensities using densitometry (ImageJ). Normalize phospho-ERK to total ERK (loading control) for each lane. Calculate phospho/total ratio for each replicate. For peak identification: one-way repeated measures ANOVA across the 5 time points, followed by Dunnett post-hoc test comparing each time point to t=0. Alternatively, fit a curve to the time series and identify the maximum. Report mean ± SEM for each time point with significance indicators.']",
