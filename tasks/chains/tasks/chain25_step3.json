What should marathon runners do to prevent post-race \"infections\"?",
  "ideal": "**H1 (epithelial damage) is strongly supported:**\n\n- Serum CC16 is dramatically elevated at 1h (4.4× baseline), confirming airway epithelial barrier disruption.\n- Nasal IL-33 (an epithelial alarmin released upon damage) peaks at 1h (5.7× baseline), driving the subsequent neutrophilic inflammation.\n- The neutrophilic infiltration peaks at 24h (35-42%), which is when symptoms peak — consistent with sterile inflammation kinetics (not viral infection, which takes 24-72h for replication).\n- **CC16 at 1h predicts symptoms at 24-72h (r=0.68)** — the strongest correlation by far. Cortisol does not significantly correlate (r=0.22, p=0.09), and lymphocyte nadir is irrelevant (r=-0.15, NS).\n- H2 (redistribution) does occur (lymphopenia at 1h, cortisol elevation) but does NOT drive symptoms. The immune redistribution is a real phenomenon but a bystander effect.\n\n**Practical recommendations for marathon runners:**\n1. **\"URTI\" symptoms are NOT infections** — antibiotics are useless and inappropriate. Anti-inflammatory approaches are warranted.\n2. **Pre-race:** Nasal saline gel or barrier spray (e.g., Pretz, Nasaleze) to protect epithelium from drying.\n3. **During race:** Maintain hydration to minimize airway drying. Consider wearing a light buff/neck gaiter in cold weather to warm and humidify inspired air.\n4. **Post-race:** Short course of intranasal corticosteroid (fluticasone) or nasal saline irrigation may reduce the sterile inflammatory response. NSAIDs (ibuprofen) may help if not contraindicated.\n5. **Reframe the \"open window\":** The post-marathon vulnerability is not immune suppression — it is airway epithelial injury. Training the airway (progressive exposure to high-ventilation exercise) may build epithelial resilience, similar to how calluses protect skin.",
