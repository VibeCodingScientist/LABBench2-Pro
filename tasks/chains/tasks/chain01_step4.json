  "question": "Based on your analysis — SHP2 autoinhibition is released by bisphosphorylated peptides with EC50 ~0.7 µM, activation is graded in the cellular concentration range, and E76K destabilizes the closed conformation — propose 3 testable hypotheses for why allosteric SHP2 inhibitors (e.g., SHP099, TNO155) show clinical efficacy in RAS-driven cancers but not in cancers with SHP2 E76K mutations (as observed in clinical trials NCT03114319).",
  "ideal": "1) **Allosteric inhibitors stabilize the closed conformation** that E76K already disrupts — the drug binding site (the interface between N-SH2 and PTP domains) is partially pre-opened in E76K, reducing inhibitor affinity by >10-fold. Testable: measure SHP099 Kd for WT vs. E76K by ITC or SPR. 2) **E76K bypasses the activation step that allosteric inhibitors block** — SHP099 prevents the conformational opening triggered by phosphopeptide binding, but E76K is constitutively open. Even complete allosteric inhibition cannot restore the autoinhibited state. Testable: measure SHP099 IC50 in phosphatase assay with E76K ± activating peptide; if peptide-independent, drug should fail regardless. 3) **Catalytic site inhibitors should retain efficacy against E76K** because the PTP active site is structurally intact. Testable: compare IC50 of allosteric (SHP099) vs. active-site inhibitor (e.g., IIB-08) against WT and E76K; predict active-site inhibitors show <3-fold shift while allosteric inhibitors show >10-fold.",
