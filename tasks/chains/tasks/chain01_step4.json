  "ideal": "[FILL: 3 specific, falsifiable hypotheses.\nExample: '1) Copper accumulation in Wilson disease displaces zinc from the His142/Cys205 coordination site, reducing X-Y binding affinity by >10-fold. 2) Hepatic zinc depletion secondary to copper overload drops local zinc below the 3 µM half-max threshold, effectively abolishing X-Y signaling. 3) The H142 residue undergoes copper-mediated oxidation in Wilson disease, permanently disrupting the zinc-binding site even after copper chelation therapy.']",
