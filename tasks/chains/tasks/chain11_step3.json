Which resistance mechanism would you predict to be MOST difficult to overcome with next-generation KRAS G12C inhibitors?\nA) Secondary mutations in KRAS at Y96D that sterically block the S-IIP pocket\nB) Upregulation of SOS1, the KRAS guanine exchange factor, shifting the GTP/GDP equilibrium\nC) Activating mutations in downstream effectors (BRAF V600E, MEK1 mutations) that bypass KRAS entirely\nD) Acquisition of a second KRAS G12C allele (gene amplification)",
