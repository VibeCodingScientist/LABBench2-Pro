  "question": "Three high-profile studies report that gut microbiome composition predicts melanoma response to anti-PD-1:\n\n**Study 1** (Science, 2018, n=112): *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* enriched in responders (16S rRNA sequencing). Germ-free mice colonized with responder stool showed better anti-PD-L1 response.\n\n**Study 2** (Science, 2018, n=42): *Bifidobacterium longum* enriched in responders (shotgun metagenomics). FMT from responders to germ-free mice improved anti-tumor immunity.\n\n**Study 3** (Nature Medicine, 2021, n=16): Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from responders to anti-PD-1-refractory melanoma patients. 6/15 (40%) showed clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease).\n\nA pharma company wants to develop a defined bacterial consortium (not FMT) containing *F. prausnitzii*, *B. longum*, and *Akkermansia muciniphila* as an adjunct to pembrolizumab. They cite these studies as \"proof of concept.\" Evaluate whether the evidence supports this development plan.",
  "ideal": "**The evidence is suggestive but insufficient to justify a specific consortium. Multiple critical weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Different \"key\" species across studies:** Study 1 identifies *F. prausnitzii*, Study 2 identifies *B. longum*, other studies identify *Akkermansia* or *Ruminococcaceae*. The lack of convergence on specific species across independent cohorts is a major red flag — it suggests the signal may be at the community/ecosystem level (diversity, metabolite output) rather than individual species.\n\n2. **Correlation ≠ causation confounders:** Responders and non-responders differ in many ways that affect the microbiome: (a) antibiotic use (non-responders more likely received prior antibiotics), (b) diet (responders may have higher fiber intake), (c) bowel habits, BMI, geography, prior treatments. Studies 1 and 2 did not adequately control for these.\n\n3. **Mouse model translation gap:** Germ-free mice have profoundly abnormal immune systems (underdeveloped Peyer's patches, reduced IgA, altered T cell repertoire). Showing that human stool \"works\" in germ-free mice demonstrates that microbiota CAN affect anti-tumor immunity, but the specific species responsible may differ from what works in humans with established, complex microbiomes.\n\n4. **Study 3 (FMT) is encouraging but very preliminary:** n=16, no control arm (no sham FMT), 40% benefit could include natural fluctuation. The 6 responders may have had favorable immune biology independent of FMT.\n\n5. **A defined consortium is NOT FMT:** The consortium assumes 3 named species are the active components. But FMT contains >1,000 species, bacteriophages, metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids), and immunomodulatory molecules. Removing >99% of this complexity and expecting the same effect is a large assumption.\n\n**Recommendation:** The development plan needs a Phase I/II randomized trial of the consortium + pembrolizumab vs. pembrolizumab alone in anti-PD-1-naive melanoma, with: (a) 16S + shotgun metagenomics + metabolomics at baseline and on-treatment, (b) stool SCFA and bile acid profiling, (c) tumor biopsy IHC for CD8+ TILs and PD-L1, (d) correlation of engraftment with response.",
