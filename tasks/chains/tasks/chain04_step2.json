  "question": "A follow-up peer-reviewed study (n=12 per group) tests compound X in three models:\n- BT142 (patient-derived, endogenous IDH1-R132H, orthotopic): 2-HG reduction 35%, tumor volume 12% reduction (p=0.31)\n- U87-IDH1R132H (subcutaneous, replication): 2-HG reduction 80%, tumor volume 38% reduction (p=0.01)\n- TS603 (patient-derived, endogenous IDH1-R132H, subcutaneous): 2-HG reduction 25%, tumor volume 8% increase (p=0.62)\n\nBrain PK: compound X brain-to-plasma ratio = 0.05 (poor BBB penetration). How does this change your assessment from Step 1?",
  "ideal": "This substantially weakens the case for compound X:\n1. **Original finding partially replicated** in U87 model (38% vs. 50% reduction) but only in the artificial overexpression system.\n2. **Patient-derived lines show minimal effect:** BT142 orthotopic (12%, NS) and TS603 (actually grew 8%). This pattern — large effect in overexpression, small in endogenous — suggests compound X potency depends on supraphysiological target expression.\n3. **2-HG reduction correlates with tumor response:** 80% 2-HG reduction → tumor shrinkage; 25-35% → no response. The drug likely doesn't achieve sufficient target engagement in endogenous-expression contexts.\n4. **Brain penetration is a dealbreaker:** Brain:plasma = 0.05 is far below the 0.3–0.5 threshold for CNS drugs. This explains the orthotopic failure — insufficient drug reaches the tumor.\n5. **Conclusion:** Compound X is a moderately potent IDH1-R132H inhibitor in vitro but fails in vivo due to poor BBB penetration. Not suitable for glioma. May have utility in peripheral IDH1-mutant cancers (cholangiocarcinoma, AML) if re-evaluated, but ivosidenib (brain:plasma ~0.3) is already superior.",
