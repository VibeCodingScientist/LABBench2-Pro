  "question": "Two landmark studies defined BRAF V600E inhibitor resistance in melanoma:\n\n**Paper A** (BRIM-3 trial, NEJM 2011): Vemurafenib vs. dacarbazine in BRAF V600E melanoma. n=675. OS: 13.6 vs. 9.7 months. HR=0.70. Progression-free survival: 5.3 vs. 1.6 months.\n\n**Paper B** (Molecular analysis of resistance, Nature 2012): Profiled 45 melanoma tumors that progressed on vemurafenib. Found: 40% had MAPK pathway reactivation (NRAS mutation, BRAF amplification, MEK1 mutation), 22% had PI3K pathway activation (PTEN loss, AKT amplification), 18% had both, 20% had no identifiable mechanism.\n\nThe crystal structure of BRAF V600E with vemurafenib (PDB: 3OG7, resolution 2.45 Å) shows the inhibitor binding the active kinase conformation. ClinVar lists 352 pathogenic BRAF variants. UniProt P15056 identifies BRAF as 766 aa with the kinase domain at 457-717. Open Targets links BRAF to melanoma indirectly (CDKN2A tops at 0.8458, PTEN at 0.7137). ChEMBL shows vemurafenib IC50 against BRAF V600E = 31 nM (CHEMBL1948324). Why does vemurafenib have such a short PFS (5.3 months) despite potent target inhibition, and what does the resistance landscape tell us about monotherapy limitations?",
  "ideal": "**Vemurafenib fails quickly despite potent BRAF inhibition because of several interacting factors:**\n\n1. **Pathway redundancy:** The MAPK pathway has extensive cross-talk and feedback regulation. When BRAF V600E is inhibited, negative feedback on RAS (mediated by ERK-dependent phosphorylation of SOS1) is released. This reactivates RAS, which can signal through: (a) WT BRAF via dimerization (vemurafenib paradoxically activates WT BRAF dimers — the \"paradox effect\"), (b) CRAF, which is not inhibited by vemurafenib, (c) direct RAS→PI3K signaling. These relief-of-feedback mechanisms provide escape routes within weeks.\n\n2. **Tumor heterogeneity:** The 40% with MAPK reactivation, 22% PI3K, 18% both, 20% unknown shows that multiple distinct resistance mechanisms co-exist — likely in different subclones within the same tumor. Any monotherapy creates a bottleneck that selects for whichever pre-existing resistant subclone is present.\n\n3. **The 20% \"unknown\" mechanisms** likely include non-genetic resistance: phenotypic switching to a mesenchymal/neural-crest-like state with reduced MAPK dependence, stromal HGF secretion activating MET, or epigenetic rewiring.\n\n4. **Short PFS reflects SELECTION, not mutation:** Most resistance mechanisms are present as rare subclones at baseline. Vemurafenib rapidly kills the dominant BRAF-dependent population (explaining the dramatic initial response), but resistant subclones expand immediately. The 5.3-month PFS is essentially the time for a resistant subclone to grow from 0.1% to clinically detectable.\n\n**Monotherapy limitation:** Targeting a single node in a highly redundant signaling network is fundamentally insufficient. This directly motivated the development of BRAF + MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib + trametinib, PFS ~12 months, OS ~25 months) and now BRAF + MEK + anti-PD-1 triple therapy.",
