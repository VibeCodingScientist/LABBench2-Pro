  "question": "[FILL: Ask model to re-analyze earlier data with the corrected understanding.\nExample: 'The original paper reported that the treatment reduces target protein X by 70% (normalized to GAPDH). Given that GAPDH itself is being degraded by caspase-3 in treated cells, is the 70% reduction in protein X real? How would you re-analyze the data, and what might the true reduction be?']",
  "ideal": "[FILL: Corrected quantification reasoning.\nExample: 'The 70% reduction is likely overestimated. If GAPDH is partially degraded in treated cells, the GAPDH denominator is artificially low, making the protein X / GAPDH ratio appear lower than reality. To correct: 1) Re-probe with total protein stain or caspase-resistant control. 2) If GAPDH is ~50% degraded in treated lane, the true protein X reduction may be closer to 40% (rough correction: 1 - (0.3 × 2) = 0.40). 3) Better: re-run the experiment with Ponceau S normalization from the start. This is a common error in apoptosis studies.']",
