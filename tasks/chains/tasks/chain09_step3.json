  "question": "Your original analysis (before discovering the GAPDH problem) reported: \"Staurosporine reduced phospho-AKT(S473) by 75% compared to vehicle (normalized to GAPDH).\" Given that GAPDH is ~30% cleaved in the staurosporine lane (meaning intact GAPDH is reduced to ~70% of its true total), answer: (a) Is the 75% reduction in pAKT real, overestimated, or underestimated? Show the math. (b) What is the likely true reduction if you correct for the GAPDH artifact? (c) You need to re-analyze the experiment properly. Describe exactly how you would re-probe the membrane and recalculate.",
  "ideal": "**(a) The 75% reduction is OVERESTIMATED.** Here's the math:\n\nThe reported ratio = (pAKT_stau / GAPDH_stau) / (pAKT_veh / GAPDH_veh) = 0.25 (i.e., 75% reduction).\n\nBut GAPDH_stau is only 70% of what it should be (30% cleaved). So the true ratio should use corrected GAPDH:\n\nLet's call the true pAKT ratio = R.\nReported: pAKT_stau / (0.70 × GAPDH_true) = 0.25 × (pAKT_veh / GAPDH_veh)\nCorrected: pAKT_stau / GAPDH_true = 0.25 × 0.70 × (pAKT_veh / GAPDH_veh) = 0.175\n\nWait — let me reconsider. The normalization divides by GAPDH. If GAPDH appears lower (70% of true), then pAKT/GAPDH is *inflated* in the staurosporine lane, meaning the drug's effect appears *smaller* than reality... \n\nActually: **Revised analysis.** Normalized pAKT = (pAKT band) / (GAPDH band). If GAPDH band is artifactually low (70% of true), then normalized pAKT = (pAKT) / (0.7 × true GAPDH) = (1/0.7) × (pAKT/true GAPDH) = 1.43× overestimate of the ratio. So the staurosporine lane's pAKT appears 1.43× higher relative to vehicle than it truly is.\n\nReported pAKT_stau / pAKT_veh (normalized) = 0.25.\nCorrected = 0.25 × 0.70 = **0.175**, meaning true reduction is ~82.5%, not 75%.\n\n**(b) The true pAKT reduction is ~82-83%.** The GAPDH artifact made the drug appear *less* effective than it actually is (denominator too small → ratio too high → drug effect appears smaller).\n\n**(c) Re-analysis procedure:**\n1. Strip the membrane (Restore stripping buffer, 15 min, RT)\n2. Re-probe with **Ponceau S total protein stain** (photograph before blocking) OR anti-vinculin antibody as validated loading control\n3. Quantify: pAKT(S473) band intensity / Ponceau total lane intensity (or vinculin band) for each lane\n4. Calculate fold-change: (corrected ratio staurosporine) / (corrected ratio vehicle)\n5. Report the corrected values and explicitly note the GAPDH artifact in the methods: \"GAPDH was initially used as loading control but showed caspase-3-dependent cleavage in staurosporine-treated samples; data were re-normalized to total protein (Ponceau S).\"",
